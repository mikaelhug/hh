# Endianness
# Different architectures interpret data differently
#   < - little endian: lowest order byte first (x86, x86_64, Arm)
#   > - big endian: highest order byte comes first (PowerPC, SPARC)
#  Potential improvement could be:
#   - using 'network byte order' (big endian)
#   - using BOM (add an identifier before all values)
#  Another practical improvement if you don't know what data is coming
#  could be checking the values to see if they are reasonable

# Optimization
# Signed 16-bit integer (int16)
# Range: -32768 â€¦ 32767
# -> Use int16 (2 bytes)
# Another optimization would be to send raw bytes instead of ASCII
# since ASCII inflates data size by 33% in this case (12 bytes for ASCII vs 8 raw bytes)

# Why aren't we just sending the data in a human readable format?
# Sending text characters would use more space!
# Sensors/edge devices may be simple without such functionality or unwanted wasted resources
# Binary values are not possible to interpret wrong (except endianness)

# Sending arbitrary amount of data
# - establish protocol to send length first then receive data
#   -> first header with data length always same size, then data
# - using a delimiter; parse chunks of data and split using agreed upon delimiter
